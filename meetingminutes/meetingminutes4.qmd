### **Agenda Item 2: Remaining Tweaks (to be done after 2 July 2025)**

The team agreed we still can make minor tweaks but will be focusing on our upcoming exams first. The team will be splitting it into below tasks.

1.     **Add contextual descriptions**

-   Insert a short explanatory blurb in the right-hand taskbar for every tab:

    -   For each tab we’ll place a brief narrative panel in the right-hand taskbar. These blurbs will do more than label controls; they will set the scene, guiding users through the data like chapters in a story so they understand *why* each view matters and can immerse themselves in Sailor Shift’s journey and the wider Oceanus Folk universe.

2.     **Graph-load optimisation**

-    Refactor large visNetwork objects and cache static data to trim initial render time.

3.     **User guide**

-   Draft a concise walkthrough with annotated screenshots; export as PDF and embed link in the app header.

### Follow-Up Tasks
