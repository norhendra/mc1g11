    "text": "Agenda Item 1: Module Selection\nPrior to the first meeting, the team had an informal discussion on 17 January 2025 and agreed to come together and finalise what modules we are working on. We discussed our ideas from Take-home Exercise 3.\nJin Yao shared that we can have a module called ‘Influence Network Explorer’ where the central node can be change to any artist. The goal of this module is to answer question 1 and question 3 influences of Sailor Shift and other artistes.\nAndre has also highlighted what he would be exploring for question 3 by having a top artist visNetwork and accompany it with a bar chart to show the top artists/songs.\nHendra also shared that for Oceanus Folk, we would only need “inward” and “outward” influences to answer question 2. This should be accompanied with an interactive plotly to which genres has the most influence count. A timeline should be added to see how the influences has affected throughout the years.\nTo conclude this agenda, we will be splitting it to 3 modules to answer each question, and they are ‘Sailor Shift’, ‘Oceanus Folk’, and ‘Other Artists’. However, we remain open to adjustments as new insights emerge."

    "text": "Agenda Item 2: UI Design\nAfter exploring several layout options, the team unanimously endorsed Hendra’s Spotify-inspired design from Take-home Exercise 3. His clean, familiar interface will not only showcase our visualizations but also set the perfect stage for an immersive audio experience.\nTo bring the fictitious genre of Oceanus Folk to life, Hendra proposed curating a sample playlist that captures its imagined soundscape. By embedding audio clips directly into our Shiny App, users will be able to toggle between tracks as they explore influence networks and timelines—deepening their connection to the music and the story behind it.\nBuilding on that idea, Jin Yao and Andre each contributed a hand-picked selection of songs whose textures and melodies evoke Oceanus Folk’s ethos. Together, their contributions will form a dynamic, exploratory playlist—so listeners can not only see how Oceanus Folk fits into the broader musical landscape but also hear its spirit firsthand.\nThe team unanimously decided on the project topic of “Global Terrorism” after considering all the different proposed ideas, as the “Global Terrorism” dataset has a comprehensive list of variables that can be worked on to explore the different visualisation techniques and methods learnt from the course. In addition, it also fulfilled the requirement of using open-source government data to build a web-enabled interactive visual analytics application."

We’ve since:\n\nCreated a Jira board.\nGenerated tickets that align with our module selection and UI design.\nAssigned each of us to specific tasks.\nAdopted the “3 C’s” framework—Card, Conversation, Confirmation—to track every story from planning through completion.\n\nBy combining a centralized repo, a clear notification process, and a sprint mindset in Jira, we’ll ensure smooth collaboration, rapid iteration, and full visibility into our progress.Follow-up on Agenda Item 3: Sprint Setup on JIRA\nhttps://nhendra.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MC1BB/boards/2\n\n\nFor Create UI for Shiny App:\n\nFor Sailor Shift Module\n\nFor Oceanus Folk Moduke\n\nFor Other Artists Module"

The team will be splitting it into below tasks.\n1.     Add contextual descriptions\n\nInsert a short explanatory blurb in the right-hand taskbar for every tab:\n\nFor each tab we’ll place a brief narrative panel in the right-hand taskbar. These blurbs will do more than label controls; they will set the scene, guiding users through the data like chapters in a story so they understand why each view matters and can immerse themselves in Sailor Shift’s journey and the wider Oceanus Folk universe.\n\n\n2.     Graph-load optimisation\n\nRefactor large visNetwork objects and cache static data to trim initial render time.\n\n3.     User guide\n\nDraft a concise walkthrough with annotated screenshots; export as PDF and embed link in the app header.\n\n\n\nFollow-Up Tasks\n\nAll tweaks will commence after 2 July 2025, once the group has completed the exam.\n\n\n\nAdjournment\nThe meeting adjourned at 1645hrs with congratulations to the team for reaching functional completion ahead of schedule."

The team was also updated to check on a few things when pulling for Git and they are:\n\nEnsure that songs are playing and play/pause button displaying as expected even when cycling through the tabs.\nEnsure the able to click ‘Next’ and songs auto-play.\nEnsure that summary tab on the right taskbar stays as what was previously selected when cycling through the tabs.\n\n\nThe sprint burn-down chart shows that the work is only 29% done. However, both Andre and Jin Yao showed great progress in their assigned stories. However, to keep within schedule the team agrees that we should speed things up."
